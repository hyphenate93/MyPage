[Dine](https://github.com/hyphenate93/Dine) is an ongoing hobby project that combines my love of cooking with full-stack web development.

It’s a modern recipe manager and meal planner built with **.NET 8** and **Blazor** (server-side). The app allows users to add their own recipes, view a randomized feed of suggestions, and generate a weekly meal plan based on stored data.
