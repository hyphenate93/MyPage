> "AI won't replace developers. Developers using AI will replace those who don't."

## The Role of AI in Software Development

There's a growing concern, sometimes even fear among developers: *Will AI replace us?* It's a fair question, especially with tools like ChatGPT, Copilot, and CodeWhisperer making their way into our daily workflows.

But here's my take: **No, AI will not replace developers.** What *will* happen, and is already happening is that **developers who use AI will replace those who don’t.**

AI is not the enemy. It’s a wrench. A very advanced, multi-purpose wrench in the modern developer’s toolbox.

## AI as a Tool, Not a Replacement

Like the wrench transformed the way we change tyres, AI is transforming how we build software. It accelerates the boring bits, boilerplate code, syntax lookups, refactoring and lets us focus on design, communication, and problem-solving. But just like a wrench doesn’t know if the bolt it's turning is about to strip, AI doesn’t inherently understand *context*. It will happily generate elegant solutions to the wrong problems if we let it.

That’s where we, the humans, come in.

## What Will Change in Our Industry

We’re moving toward a future where remembering syntax or knowing ten programming languages by heart won't be as valued. Why? Because AI tools will know all of that, and more.

What *will* be valued?

- **Understanding the fundamentals of programming**  
  Can you tell when AI has misunderstood the task? Can you debug and guide it?

- **Communication skills**  
  Can you talk to clients, ask the right questions, and translate business needs into clean, logical prompts and workflows?

- **Tool selection and judgement**  
  Knowing *what* tool (or AI prompt) to use is becoming just as important as knowing *how* to code.

## Rethinking Interviews

As AI reshapes the way we build software, it's also going to change the way we hire developers.

I believe we'll shift away from strict algorithmic challenges and language-specific trivia ("Can you invert this binary tree in under 20 lines?") and toward interviews that test **problem understanding**, **pseudo-code thinking**, and **AI fluency**.

In short: *Can this developer break down a problem, understand what needs to be done, and leverage the right tools, AI included to solve it efficiently?*

## The Future is Hybrid

The developers of tomorrow won’t just write code. They’ll curate, guide, and co-create alongside intelligent tools. And just like knowing when not to use a wrench, knowing when not to trust the AI will be what separates the good from the great.

We’re not being replaced.

We’re being **upgraded**, and those who adapt will thrive.
