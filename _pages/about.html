<h1>ðŸ‘‹ Welcome! I'm Andreas Ã–stlin</h1>
    <h2>Father. Husband. Developer. Chef. Writer.</h2>
    <p>I'm a full-stack developer based in Halmstad, Sweden, working mainly with .NET, Node.js, and modern front-end frameworks like Vue. I specialise in making complex tech feel simple, whether through clean, maintainable code, mentoring new developers, or giving talks that demystify intimidating topics.</p>
    <p>Before tech, I trained and worked as a professional chef, and that same blend of creativity and discipline now fuels everything I build. When Iâ€™m not coding, youâ€™ll find me writing fantasy fiction, running long distances to clear my head, or out in nature with my wife, our daughter, and our dog.</p>
    <p>This site is part portfolio, part creative outlet. Here youâ€™ll find my living CV, personal blog posts, and updates on my writing projects, including previews and progress toward future book releases.</p>
