This talk focuses on how everyday knowledge workers—not just developers—can boost productivity by integrating AI tools into their regular workflows.

We explore real-world use cases ranging from cleaning and formatting Excel spreadsheets to using AI as a thought partner for sparking creativity or overcoming writer's block. I share strategies for writing quickly and messily, then using AI to iterate into clear, professional outputs.

From grammar checking and summarisation to generating outlines and simplifying documentation, I present AI not as a replacement—but as a patient, judgment-free colleague who helps you think better, work faster, and polish smarter.

This session encourages attendees to view AI as a co-worker and embrace its role in modern knowledge work.
