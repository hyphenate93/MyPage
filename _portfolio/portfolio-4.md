This entry showcases three unique web projects I've designed, built, and hosted myself using static site generators, vanilla JS, and GitHub Pages:

---

### ✂️ [The Barber House Halmstad](https://thebarberhousehalmstad.se/)
- Built for a local barber to boost visibility and provide direct booking access
- SEO optimised, lightweight, mobile-friendly design
- Focus on clarity, simplicity, and Googleability

---

### 💍 [Sörbu Östlin Wedding Site](https://sorbuostlin.com/)
- A fully **serverless** wedding website that mimics backend logic
- Handles RSVP, dietary restrictions, and speech submissions
- Uses GitHub Pages, JS, and Google Forms for free hosting

---

### 🌐 [This Website](https://andreasostlin.com/)
- [Built with Jekyll and GitHub Pages based on the Academic Pages GitHub template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io)

- Custom layout, archive system, and Markdown-based project management
---

These projects demonstrate my ability to work across design, hosting, and client needs—balancing simplicity with functionality.
