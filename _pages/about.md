## System Developer. Chef. Fiction Writer. Runner. Dog Dad.

I'm a full-stack developer based in Halmstad, Sweden, working mainly with .NET, Node.js, and modern front-end frameworks like Vue. I specialise in making complex tech feel simple—whether through clean, maintainable code, mentoring new developers, or giving talks that demystify intimidating topics.

Before tech, I trained and worked as a professional chef—and that same blend of creativity and discipline now fuels everything I build. When I’m not coding, you’ll find me writing fantasy fiction, running long distances to clear my head, or out in nature with my wife and our dog.

This site is part portfolio, part creative outlet. Here you’ll find my living CV, personal blog posts, and updates on my writing projects—including previews and progress toward future book releases.
