**Dying Roses**  

BETRAYAL. WAR. MAGIC . . . The kingdoms are crumbling. The forest nomads once known for their peace now wield a magic that twists life into death. The elves have locked their gates, vanishing behind their ancient walls. And humanity teeters on the brink of extinction.  

King Ghalen has spent years fighting a war he cannot win. But when a captured enemy awakens with no memory and power that could rival legends, she may be the key to salvation â€” or the herald of their destruction.
