This thesis was the result of a collaborative project between Halmstad University, Conmore Engineering, and a construction industry client. The goal was to automate the testing and documentation of pressurised pipe installations, a task that is traditionally done manually using a manometer over long durations.

Through collaborative specification workshops and prototyping, we delivered a system that:
- Measures pressure in real time via both a physical monitor and a web-based API
- Stores historical measurement sessions for easy retrieval and compliance
- Lays the groundwork for further expansion into automated safety checks and real-time alerts

The project not only met all minimum client expectations but also introduced additional features not initially requested, while identifying other more complex requirements best suited for a follow-up project.

The thesis explores both the technical implementation and the practical implications of automation in construction workflows. It includes architectural decisions, embedded programming, API development, and UI design for industrial use cases.
