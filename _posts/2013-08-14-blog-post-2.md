**Learning to Write Fiction – From Zero to Hero**

I don’t consider myself a master of the craft, but I’ve come a long way in the last four years. With one finished novel under my belt, a sequel in the works, and three other projects simmering, I’ve learned a thing or two about what it means to write fiction. So, how does someone learn to write from scratch?

Well, let’s get this out of the way: there are no shortcuts. You can’t watch a few YouTube videos and expect to become the next Sanderson. Trust me, I’ve tried.

But you *can* get better. And you will, if you just start.


Start By Writing
------

It sounds simple—and it is. The first, most important step is to write. That’s how you improve. Write messy drafts, write terrible characters, write awful dialogue. Then write again. And again. Because the only way to learn storytelling is to tell stories.

That said, there *are* ways to flatten the learning curve.

Join writing groups. Read other people’s work. Share your own. Be open to critique. This is the hardest part for many new writers, because writing is vulnerable. You’re exposing your thoughts, your ideas, and your creativity. But here’s the truth: your words aren’t magical. They can become magic, but only once you’re willing to let others help you shape them.

To paraphrase Joe Abercrombie: *“Writing is hard work. And most of the time not fun work.”* And he’s right. Some feedback will sting. Some people will be unhelpful. But buried even in the harshest critique, there’s often a golden nugget, something you can improve on.

A Strategy That Won’t Leave You Rewriting 300,000 Words
------

Here’s a tip I wish someone had drilled into my skull before I dove headfirst into a 100,000-word epic: don’t start by writing the whole damn novel.

Seriously, write two to three chapters. Tinker with them. Shape them like you’re carving a tiny literary statue. Then, and this is crucial; walk away. Let them breathe. Let your brain breathe. Go take a walk. Pet a dog. Forget you ever wrote them.

When you come back, you’ll see them with fresh eyes and, more importantly, a new brain cell or two. That’s when you polish those chapters until they shine like a dragon’s hoard. Now you’re ready to dive into the oceans of writing advice, YouTube lectures, blog posts, and all that jazz.

Why? Because once you’ve actually written something, all those abstract tips suddenly make sense. “Avoid passive voice”? Boom, you remember that one paragraph where literally nothing happened. “Show, don’t tell”? Yep, you just told us your main character was angry twelve different ways without a single clenched fist in sight.

Now that your chapters are battle-tested and knowledge-fortified, get yourself a critique partner. Someone who will tell you the truth gently, and not just say “it’s good” because they’re afraid of breaking your spirit. You’ll learn more from a good critique partner than you will from your fifth rewatch of the Sanderson lectures (though still… rewatch them).

Trust me, I wrote an entire novel, then looked at it with fresh eyes… and rewrote the entire thing. Then I watched all the videos, rewrote it again. Then I got a critique partner and, you guessed it... rewrote it again. Don’t be me. Be smarter than me. Start small, learn fast, rewrite less.

Final Thoughts
------

Writing isn’t a destination, it’s a journey. And while it may start with clunky paragraphs and awkward dialogue, over time you’ll surprise yourself. The magic you were chasing? It’ll start to show up on the page. And when it does, it’s all worth it.

Keep writing.
